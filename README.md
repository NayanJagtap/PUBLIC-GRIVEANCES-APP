# PUBLIC GRIVEANCES APP
Topic-Public Griveance app for cities
Description-Here I am going to make an android app for public griveance regarding various issues present in that particular area.
For example -if there is a issue like spread of epedimic or failure of electricity or robbery etc. 
We are going to make an app which is similar when we fill google forms or while filling for voter card there it is observed that in address section there is  something like 
State=>District=>City/Village=>Area/Society Name
Here the respective person have to traverse to the above flow. So the proper address of the person is stored and a page of that area will be open. Where he/she can submit their grievance .and that will go to concerned department
(note:As this project is not commercial it is for college project so we have linked a phone number of our friends.
Inplace of original department employees data)
